## Overview

The Group Organizer Program, also known as "Agrupate," is designed to facilitate the creation of study groups for students. It assigns students to groups based on user input and organizes their study sessions with breaks, inspired by the Pomodoro Technique.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA can be used to run the program.

### Running the Program

3. Follow the on-screen instructions:

   - Enter your name when prompted.
   - Provide a list of student names separated by commas.
   - Specify the total session time in minutes.

4. The program will then:

   - Organize students into groups of 2 to 5, depending on the total number of students.
   - Determine the duration of concentration sessions, considering the Pomodoro Technique.
   - Assign breaks and group changes as needed.
   - Display the schedule of study sessions and breaks.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the program:
